# CoCoDV Relocator Board

This board allows AC's 8-bit Zone CoCoDV board to be placed into a Color Computer 1 Revision F board *without* cutting the center post.

## Bonus

I also designed a 3-D printed case for the remote control board for the CoCoDV.  Is it located in the CoCoDvCase folder.  It does not require any cutting of the case.  It just fits between the two case shells very securely.

You can see here how it just fits over the edge of the bottom case.

Here is the complete setup - AC's CoCoDV provides an incredibly sharp picture!
